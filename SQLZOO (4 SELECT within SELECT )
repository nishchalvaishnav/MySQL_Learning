Ans ==> select continent, name , area from world as x where area  >= all  (select area from world as y where x.continent = y.continent and y.area > 0)


8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

Ans ==> select continent , name from world as x where name <= all(select name from world as y where x.continent = y.continent)


9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

Ans ==> Select name, continent, population from world where continent in (select continent from world  x where 25000000 >= (select max(population) from world y where x.continent = y.continent));


10.Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

Ans ==> select name, continent from world x where population > all(select  3*population from  world y where x.continent = y.continent and x.name <> y.name)
